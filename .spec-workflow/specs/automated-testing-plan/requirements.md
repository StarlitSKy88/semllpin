# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the scope and requirements for an automated testing system for the SmellPin platform, covering unit, integration, end-to-end (E2E), performance/load, and multi-agent concurrent user simulation tests. The goal is to ensure system reliability, scalability, security, and user experience quality across critical features like paid prank pins, LBS rewards, user auth/wallet, and moderation.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This testing capability supports SmellPinâ€™s vision of delivering a fun, scalable, and safe geo-social platform by ensuring:
- Fast iteration with confidence via automated regressions.
- High performance under viral traffic while keeping costs manageable.
- Strong defense against abuse (spam, fraud, location spoofing).
- Excellent UX with robust field reliability across devices and geographies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Unit and Integration Testing Foundation

User Story: As a developer, I want a comprehensive unit/integration test suite so that I can refactor safely and ship faster with high confidence.

Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a PR is opened THEN CI SHALL run jest unit/integration tests and report coverage >= 80% backend, >= 70% frontend.
2. IF DB-dependent tests run THEN system SHALL provision an ephemeral SQLite (dev) or Postgres test DB and Redis mock per test run, apply migrations, and tear down cleanly.
3. WHEN services call external providers (payments, map tiles, SMS/email) THEN tests SHALL use mocks/fakes without hitting real networks.

### Requirement 2: End-to-End (E2E) Testing

User Story: As a QA engineer, I want E2E tests that simulate real user journeys so that critical flows remain functional across releases.

Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN E2E is triggered THEN Playwright SHALL spin up the app, seed test data, and validate flows: create paid pin, geofence reward claim, signup/login, wallet recharge/withdraw, moderation queue.
2. IF network flakiness occurs THEN tests SHALL retry idempotent steps and capture HAR, console, and screenshots for failures.
3. WHEN E2E completes THEN artifacts (videos, traces) SHALL be uploaded to CI for debugging.

### Requirement 3: Performance and Load Testing

User Story: As an SRE, I want automated performance tests so that the platform meets SLA under realistic load and hotspots.

Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN load tests run THEN system SHALL hit API endpoints and WS channels with realistic traffic mix (read 80%, write 20%), geo-hotspot skew, and burstiness.
2. IF latency p95 exceeds 200ms or error rate > 1% THEN test SHALL fail and export metrics (throughput, CPU/mem, DB/Redis latency, GC/heap) to a report.
3. WHEN tests finish THEN artifacts SHALL include time-series charts and regression comparison to previous runs.

### Requirement 4: Multi-Agent Concurrent User Simulation

User Story: As a product owner, I want multi-agent simulations to test social dynamics so that the reward and prank ecosystem behaves fairly and remains engaging.

Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN simulations run THEN agents of multiple roles (Creators, Hunters, Moderators, Abusers) SHALL act concurrently following scripted/LLM-driven policies.
2. IF agent behavior causes policy violations THEN the system SHALL record detections, mitigations, and collateral damage metrics.
3. WHEN simulation ends THEN a summary report SHALL include rewards distribution fairness, abuse detection precision/recall, and UX friction.

### Requirement 5: Security and Abuse Testing

User Story: As a security engineer, I want automated security checks so that common vulnerabilities and misuse patterns are detected early.

Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN CI runs THEN dependency scanning and basic DAST SHALL execute; authenticated abuse test cases (rate limit, replay, location spoof) SHALL be exercised in staging.
2. IF a vulnerability or abuse regression is detected THEN pipeline SHALL fail with actionable evidence and reproduction steps.
3. WHEN secrets are used in tests THEN they SHALL be injected via CI secrets and never hardcoded.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- Single Responsibility Principle: Each test module targets a single subsystem or flow.
- Modular Design: Shared test utilities for seeding, auth, API client, fixtures.
- Dependency Management: Mocks/fakes for external services; isolated DB and cache per run.
- Clear Interfaces: Stable helper APIs for creating users, pins, payments, and geofence events.

### Performance
- p95 latency < 200ms for APIs under planned load; WS message delivery within 150ms p95.
- Load tests scalable to 10k+ concurrent virtual users with ramp/burst stages.

### Security
- Tests run with least-privilege credentials and sanitized datasets.
- No secrets committed to repo; CI-managed secrets only.

### Reliability
- Flaky-test budget < 1% over rolling 30 days; automatic retries for known-transient failures.
- Test runs reproducible with deterministic seeds where practical.

### Usability
- One-command execution for each test suite; clear, searchable reports with pass/fail reasons and links to artifacts.
